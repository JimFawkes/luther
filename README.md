# Project Luther

This is my second Project for the Metis Data Science Bootcamp.
Presented January 25th, 2019

The Task was to use:
 - Web-scraping to get at least a portion of the Data
 - Linear Regression to get insights


The Question I wanted to answer was:
 _"How great of an impact on your GitHub Repository can I predict if it is featured on a Python Podcast?"_


____

This repository contains the code used to 
 - get the data
 - clean it
 - divide it into a training (60%), validation (20%) and test (20%) set
 - run, fit and validate models on the data
